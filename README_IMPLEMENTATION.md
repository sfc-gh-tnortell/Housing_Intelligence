# Housing Intelligence - Snowflake Cortex Analyst Implementation

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Snowflake Agent with Cortex Analyst capabilities for housing sales analysis. The system enables natural language querying of housing sales data, customer demographics, and property characteristics.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The solution consists of:
- **Database & Schema**: Structured storage for housing data
- **Data Tables**: Customer, property characteristics, and sales transaction data  
- **Semantic Model**: YAML-based model defining relationships and business context
- **Semantic View**: SQL view with derived dimensions and measures
- **Cortex Analyst**: Natural language to SQL conversion engine
- **Dashboard Views**: Pre-built analytics for common queries

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup
```sql
-- Execute the database setup script
@01_database_setup.sql
```
This creates:
- `HOUSING_INTELLIGENCE` database
- `CORE` schema
- Three main tables: `CUSTOMERS`, `HOUSE_CHARACTERISTICS`, `HOUSE_SALES`
- Indexes and constraints for performance

### Step 2: Load Sample Data
```sql
-- Execute the sample data script
@02_sample_data.sql
```
This populates the tables with realistic sample data for testing.

### Step 3: Deploy Semantic Model
1. Upload the YAML semantic model to Snowflake:
```sql
PUT file://03_semantic_model.yaml @HOUSING_INTELLIGENCE.CORE.SEMANTIC_MODELS;
```
2. Execute the semantic view creation:
```sql
@04_semantic_view.sql
```

### Step 4: Setup Cortex Analyst
```sql
-- Execute the Cortex Analyst setup
@05_cortex_analyst_setup.sql
```

## üìä Data Model

### Core Tables

#### CUSTOMERS
- Customer demographics and preferences
- Income, credit score, family information
- Buying preferences and budget ranges

#### HOUSE_CHARACTERISTICS  
- Property details: location, size, features
- Amenities: pool, fireplace, garage
- Neighborhood and school district information

#### HOUSE_SALES
- Transaction records linking customers to properties
- Pricing, financing, and agent information
- Market timing and contingency details

### Derived Dimensions

The semantic view adds calculated dimensions:
- **Customer Age Groups**: Under 30, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+
- **Income Brackets**: Under $50K, $50K-$75K, $75K-$100K, $100K-$150K, $150K+
- **Credit Ratings**: Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent
- **Property Size Categories**: Small, Medium, Large, Very Large
- **Property Age Categories**: New, Recent, Modern, Established, Vintage
- **Market Timing**: Very Fast, Fast, Normal, Slow

## üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Queries

With Cortex Analyst deployed, you can ask questions like:

### Market Analysis
- "What is the average sale price by property type?"
- "Show me the top 5 neighborhoods by average sale price"
- "How has the average days on market changed over time?"
- "What percentage of sales are cash vs financed?"

### Customer Analysis  
- "How does customer income affect the price of homes they buy?"
- "What is the most popular property type for families with children?"
- "Compare purchasing patterns between married and single customers"
- "What credit score range buys the most expensive homes?"

### Property Analysis
- "Which property features correlate with higher sale prices?"
- "How does walkability affect property values?"
- "Compare price per square foot across different cities"
- "What is the relationship between property age and sale speed?"

### Financial Analysis
- "What is the average down payment percentage by income bracket?"
- "How do interest rates vary by customer credit score?"
- "What are the total commission amounts by agent?"
- "Compare closing costs across different financing types?"

## üìà Pre-built Analytics

The implementation includes several analytical views:

### MONTHLY_SALES_TRENDS
Monthly aggregated metrics for trend analysis

### PROPERTY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE  
Performance comparison across property types

### GEOGRAPHIC_ANALYSIS
Location-based pricing and market analysis

### CUSTOMER_SEGMENT_ANALYSIS
Customer behavior segmentation

## üîß Usage Examples

### Using Cortex Analyst
```sql
SELECT CORTEX_ANALYST_QUERY(
    'HOUSING_ANALYST',
    'What is the average sale price for homes with pools in Austin?'
);
```

### Using Pre-built Procedures
```sql
-- Get market summary
CALL MARKET_ANALYSIS_SP();

-- Get customer analysis
CALL CUSTOMER_ANALYSIS_SP();
```

### Querying Analytical Views
```sql
-- View property type performance
SELECT * FROM PROPERTY_TYPE_PERFORMANCE;

-- View geographic trends
SELECT * FROM GEOGRAPHIC_ANALYSIS 
WHERE CITY = 'Austin';
```

## üéØ Key Features

### Business Intelligence Capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Automatic SQL Generation**: Cortex converts questions to optimized SQL
- **Rich Semantic Context**: YAML model provides business context
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Customer, property, temporal, and geographic dimensions

### Performance Optimizations
- Indexed tables for fast queries
- Pre-aggregated views for common analyses  
- Efficient joins using primary/foreign key relationships
- Calculated fields stored in semantic view

### Extensibility
- Modular design allows easy addition of new data sources
- Semantic model can be extended with new dimensions/measures
- Additional analytical views can be created as needed
- Support for both streaming and batch data updates

## üîê Security & Permissions

All objects are created with appropriate permissions for `SYSADMIN` role. For production deployment:
1. Create dedicated roles for different user groups
2. Implement row-level security if needed
3. Set up proper data governance policies
4. Configure audit logging for compliance

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Adding New Data
```sql
-- Insert new customers
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES (...);

-- Insert new properties  
INSERT INTO HOUSE_CHARACTERISTICS VALUES (...);

-- Insert new sales
INSERT INTO HOUSE_SALES VALUES (...);
```

### Updating Semantic Model
1. Modify the YAML file with new dimensions/measures
2. Re-upload to the stage
3. Refresh the Cortex Analyst configuration

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance through Snowflake's query history
- Analyze Cortex Analyst usage patterns
- Update indexes based on actual query patterns
